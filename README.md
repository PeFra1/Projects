# Upwork repository
The goal of this repository is to track my work related to the [Upwork] job posting 
applications I have tackled
- My work is going to be organized in folders for each job I am trying to solve
- I will try to note the status of each application (if I have applied)
- Fingers crossed for ✨Magic ✨ - >Money

## Tackeled problems

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

This markdown page is created using a [Dillinger] service. Maybe Ill use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) in the future...

[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job. There is no need to format nicely because it shouldn't be seen. Thanks SO - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/store-comments-in-markdown-syntax)
