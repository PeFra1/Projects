# Upwork repository
The goal of this repository is to track my work related to the [Upwork] job posting 
applications I have tackled as user PetarF (user ID f9bd78e3)
- My work is going to be organized in folders for each job I am trying to solve
- I will try to note the status of each application (if I have applied)
- Fingers crossed for ✨Magic ✨ - >Money
